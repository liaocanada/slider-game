# Fifteen Slider Puzzle
Some intro text

## Getting Started
You can run this Java program either through an IDE, or through the command line:
1. Download the files onto your computer
2. `cd ` to the directory above the `slider` package folder
3. In a terminal, run `javac slider/SliderApplication.java`
If this gives some errors, you are likely either missing Java or JavaFX -- see the below collapsible on how to install it. 
Otherwise, proceed onto the next final step.
5. Run `java slider.SliderApplication`

### Getting Java and JavaFX installed
Open a command prompt and type `javac -version`. Java 11 or later does not come with JavaFX installed, so I suggest installing Oracle Java (JDK) 8 [here](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) if you do not have Java installed or you have a later version. Then follow the steps in the install wizard.

#### Extra steps - Windows
After installation, you might need to add the install location to the PATH variable. Instructions for how to do this are shown in [this link](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.xml). 

You may also need to remove other versions of Java, or just remove the old directory from the PATH variable.

Finally repeat the steps in the Getting Started section above.

#### Extra steps - Mac
To remove the other versions of Java (if applicable), go to: `/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/` and move the folders which aren't `jdk1.8.0_231.jdk` to the Trash or somewhere else.

Finally repeat the steps in the Getting Started section above.
